## Custom Select Element
A lightweight, pure JavaScript, CSS, and HTML solution for customizing the default select element. The custom select component is fully customizable and syncs with the state of the hidden `select` tag.
You can add event listeners to the hidden `select` element to handle changes.

## How to use?
1. Include the `custom-select.js` file in your project.
2. Add the select element to your HTML with its options. (define classnames for the select element and the options).
3. Add the custom select styles to your CSS file (make changes to the styles as per your requirements).

See the example for more details.
